<h2>Introduction</h2>

Software development has an integral role in every financial organisation; indeed, almost every service provided by a bank utilizes some form of software solution. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no venue which targets the specific challenges faced by the software development teams in the financial sector. While SE research has led to solutions and innovations for many popular SE problems, there remains unresolved challenges, particularly, those challenges faced in software development in financial firms. An example of such a challenge is defect prediction, where defects are not equal as some may lead to larger reputational and financial damage than others. Consequently, testing and verification is burdened with a further set of restraints for finance-based SE teams. 

Financial firms began automating processes as early as the 1960s, and as such, must maintain large legacy systems which may host critical operations. This problem is further exacerbated by the numerous mergers and acquisitions common in the financial sector, which leaves firms with a set of heterogeneous legacy systems that need to communicate with one another effectively and efficiently. Therefore, maintaining these systems while modernizing them leads to intriguing challenges, spanning from model extraction and process optimisation, to code-translation. Moreover, highly regulated institutions like financial firms require a high degree of transparency and accountability. This requirements facilitates the need for model fairness and explanability for any SE solution, in particular those that rely on AI.

We believe that collaboration between academia and industry is crucial for progress in tackling SE challenges faced by financial firms. Indeed, JP Morgan Chase, as one of the leading global financial firms, has established a faculty research award program, through which it engages in collaborations with researchers from academia to tackle real-world challenges faced by the firm. These collaborations not only provide fruitful research, but also reminded us that there tends to be a gap between the assumptions made in academia and real-world situations faced in industry.  Therefore, the motivation behind FinanSE is to provide the SE community in both industry and academia with a unique opportunity to discuss such challenges and work in collaboration towards effective solutions.
