FinanSE'24 invites submissions of original contributions on methods, theories, applications, and systems on software engineering, with a focus on *Software Engineering Challenges in Financial Domain*. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

- Software system monitoring and analytics
- Search-based software engineering and optimisation 
- Software reliability, testing, and high value defects prediction
- Software modernisation and cloud migration
- Code translation from low resource programming languages
- Programming without coding (natural language to software)
- AI-assisted domain data tagging, labeling, and annotation for IR tasks;  automatic data extraction from financial filings and quality verification; 
- Model extraction for legacy software systems in low data and highly regulated environments
- Model explainability and fairness


<h2>Submissions</h2>

This workshop accepts both research papers and extended abstracts:
- Research papers (8 pages max, including text, figures, tables, references, and appendix) on novel approaches, tools, datasets, or studies.
- Extended abstracts (2 pages max, including text, figures, tables, references, and appendix) on novel ideas and preliminary results that have yet to be fully developed.

All papers will be submitted via HotCRP. FinanSE'24 will follow a double-blinded review process.
